Start

1. Define a function that will count the packages.
2. Inside this function, repeat the following steps:
   - Start with the number 2 (since each package contains 2 products).
   - Print this number.
   - Add 2 to the number each time a package is scanned(to represent counting two products per package).
   - Print the new number after each scan.
   - Continue doing this until you reach 50.
3. Once the number reaches 50, stop counting and print "No more packages will fit in this case. Would you like to start a new case?"
4. If "Yes" button is selected, repeat steps 1-3.

End

In summary, the program counts from 2 to 50 in increments of 2, representing scanning product packages where each scan accounts for 2 products.
